       <h1>IN FRANCE :</h1>
        <p>
          IN FRANCE BEFORE 70 YEARS AGO THERE WAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN FRANCE AND THIS TIME IS WHEN MARVEL AND AVENGERS AND COMICS AT ALL HAVE BEEN WRITING TO GIVE FAITH TO PEOPLE MEAN WHILE OUR MAIN CHARACTER GASTON COURTOIS WAS A RICH MAN HE WANTED TO MAKE PEOPLE LEARN AND BEING EDUCATED.
        </p>
        <p>
          BUT BECAUSE HE WASN'T POOR HIS RICH FAMILLY DIDN'T LIKE HIM TO BE WITH POOR PEOPLES OR HOMLESS OR ETC IN THIS TYPE . TO TELL POORS TO THAT THEY SHOULD LEARN THAT WAS THE MOST FATAL TROUBLE IN HIS WAY 
        </p>
        <p>
          PEOPLES LOVED MARVELS IDEAS CUZ IT WAS THE FAITH ON THEIR LIFE CUZ THEY WERE IN HARD TIMES AND IGNORANCE TIME TOO .
        </p>
        <p>
          AFTER THAT OUR MAIN CHARACTER GASTON COURTOIS DECIDED TO TAKE THE CHANCE AND TELL THEM THAT THEY CAN BE HEROS LIKE MARVELS AND AVENGERS AND CHANGE THEIR LIFE TO SUCH BETTER ONE AND THIS IS NOT HARD .
        </p>
        <p>
          MAYBE THE 1ST QUESTION CAME INTO YOUR MIND IS HOW WE WILL BE HEROS .HE TELLS THEM EVERYDAY GUIDE IN CHARITÉ AND HOW TO BE PERFECT .
        </p>
        <p> +BY WRITING . THEY WROTE A LOT OF COMICS ABOUT HOW TO BE THE BEST OR ABOUT HOW TO READ OR LEARN MORE THINGS AND BY THE PROFIT THEY DONATE AND MAKE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS TO HELP ALL PEOPLES </p>
